    <h1>Privacy Policy – Blackout – Party Game</h1>
    <p>
      This privacy policy describes how the mobile application <strong>Blackout – Party Game</strong> (hereinafter
      referred to as "the Application") collects, processes, and protects the personal data of its users. The
      Application is published by <strong>Yoann Demangeau</strong>, sole proprietor, registered with the Nantes Trade
      and Companies Register under number <strong>SIREN 979 206 026</strong>, whose business address is <strong>3
        impasse des Indulgences, 44980 Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire, France</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any questions regarding this policy, users may contact the publisher via email at: <a
        href="mailto:blackout.dev.app@gmail.com">blackout.dev.app@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The publisher is committed to ensuring transparency and compliance with applicable legal provisions on data
      protection, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, known as the General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy applies exclusively to the Application and its features. It does not cover third-party services or
      websites that may be accessible from within the Application.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="information-we-may-collect">
    <h2>1. Data collected and processed</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Blackout – Party Game</strong> application does not collect or store any directly identifiable
      personal data. No account creation is required, and the publisher has no access to any personally identifiable
      information about users.
    </p>
    <p>
      To manage access to paid content, the Application uses the third-party solution <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, which
      interacts with the App Store and Google Play platforms to verify subscription validity. This verification includes
      technical data such as the subscription type (weekly, monthly, or annual), purchase date, expiration date, and a
      transaction identifier provided by the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data is processed solely to activate or deactivate access to premium features. It is not used for any other
      purpose, is not shared, and does not allow users to be personally identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Application may also locally process certain anonymous technical information, such as the operating system
      version or the status of internal functions, solely to ensure proper operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      No advertising identifiers, location data, browsing history, or sensitive information are collected by the
      Application.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="legal-basis">
    <h2>2. Legal basis for processing</h2>
    <p>
      The technical data processed by the Application, particularly those related to subscription status, are necessary
      to provide access to paid features. This processing is based on the legal ground of contract performance, as set
      out in Article 6.1(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      Processing is limited to what is strictly necessary to verify a user’s eligibility for certain features and is not
      used for any commercial, advertising, or behavioral purposes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="confidentiality">
    <h2>3. Confidentiality and security</h2>
    <p>
      The Application does not transmit any personal data to third parties, except for the technical information
      required to verify a subscription. This data is securely managed via the RevenueCat solution, which applies
      industry-standard security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      No personal information, email address, or payment details are collected, stored, or accessible by the publisher.
      Purchase transactions are handled exclusively by the App Store or Google Play platforms.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="international-transfers">
    <h2>4. International data transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Some technical processing performed through RevenueCat, particularly for subscription verification, may occur
      outside the European Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data involved is strictly technical in nature and cannot, under any circumstance, be used to personally
      identify the user.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="tracking">
    <h2>5. Tracking technologies</h2>
    <p>
      The Application does not include any tracking tools, advertising trackers, or user behavior analytics.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="uses-made-of-information">
    <h2>6. Purpose of processing</h2>
    <p>
      The technical information processed by the Application is used exclusively to verify access to paid content and to
      ensure the proper operation of features related to the subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data is never used for advertising, commercial, or profiling purposes.
