    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>
      Blackout – Party Game is a party application intended for local use only. No account creation or internet
      connection is required.
      The app is free to access, with certain content reserved for users with an active subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is designed exclusively for recreational and private use among adults. It must be used
      responsibly, in accordance with applicable laws and with respect for others.
    </p>

  <section id="subscription">
    <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Blackout – Party Game offers a subscription that grants access to all premium features and content. Three
      subscription types are available: weekly, monthly, and annual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscription payments are processed via your App Store or Google Play account upon purchase confirmation. Unless
      cancelled by the user, subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each period. The corresponding amount will
      be charged within 24 hours prior to the renewal, at the rate in effect at the time of billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may manage your subscription and disable auto-renewal at any time via your Apple or Google account settings.
      For assistance, please refer to the official App Store or Google Play support centres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prices are displayed in euros and may be adjusted at any time without prior notice. Temporary promotional offers
      may be made available but do not entitle users to retroactive discounts on previous purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a free trial period is offered, any unused portion will be forfeited if a subscription is purchased before the
      trial ends. Trial cancellations must be made via your Apple or Google account settings at least 24 hours before
      the trial expires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a subscription period begins, it cannot be cancelled or refunded. However, auto-renewal may be disabled at
      any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Publisher is not liable for the unavailability, whether temporary or permanent, of the application on
      distribution platforms (App Store, Google Play), including in the event of removal or suspension of the
      application.
